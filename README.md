# Characters
Three computer-characters to play against which are Åke, Sixten and Elisabeth. They are all members of the farm.

Åke:
The rabbit who cant be caught. He is not the smartest of all animals on the farm but always thinks three steps forward.

Sixten:
Is the local mouse-hunting cat who sees four movements forward. Smarter than a rabbit but more lazy.

Elisabeth:
One of the sheeps. Extremely smart compared to normal sheeps. Thinks five moves in advance.


The animals estimate the values of the board pieces:
Pawn: 1
Knight: 3
Bishop: 4
Rook: 5
Queen: 9
